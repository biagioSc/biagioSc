## 👨‍💻 About Me

I graduated in July 2024 with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Naples Federico II, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Cybersecurity at the University of Salerno. During my academic career, I have acquired solid skills in major programming languages, including Java, Python, Kotlin, C, and C++, as well as markup languages such as HTML, CSS, and LaTeX.

Through the projects developed over the years, I gained a strong understanding of the software development process, with particular focus on mobile application development. I have also gained experience using deployment tools such as Docker and version control systems like Git.

Although my academic goal is to complete my studies in Cybersecurity, I have a strong interest in front-end development, with particular attention to UX/UI design. I therefore aim to further specialize in this area by combining technical expertise with design skills.

I am currently seeking a job opportunity that would allow me either to deepen my knowledge in the cybersecurity field, apply my skills as a developer, or explore and grow professionally in the field of UX/UI design.

If you want, I can also tailor it for a CV, LinkedIn profile, or make it slightly more concise or more persuasive depending on the context.
